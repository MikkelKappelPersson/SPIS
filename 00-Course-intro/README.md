Signal Processing Blocks of Edge Impulse
================

Extracting meaningful features from your data is crucial to building small and reliable machine learning models, and in [Edge Impulse this is done through processing blocks](https://docs.edgeimpulse.com/docs/edge-impulse-studio/processing-blocks). We ship a number of processing blocks for common sensor data (such as vibration and audio):

# Custom processing blocks

If you have a very specific sensor, want to apply custom filters, or are implementing the latest research in digital signal processing, follow the [Edge Impulse tutorial on Building custom processing blocks](https://github.com/edgeimpulse/processing-blocks).
